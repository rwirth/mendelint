# Mendelint
A cleaning tool for Mendeley's BibTeX output.

## Purpose
BibTeX output produced by tools like Mendeley can be messy.
The same journal is referred to by different name variants, there is a mixture of LaTeX escapes and native unicode, etc.
Mendelint tries to clean up the output by unifying journal names, and converting all LaTeX escapes to unicode code points or vice versa.
Additionally, it can truncate author lists to a given length.

## Usage
The output of Mendelint is twofold:
```
mendelint strings short -o short.bib
```
produces a file with a `@string` entry for each known journal, mapping to the short (abbreviated) variant of that name.
The main cleaning is done by the `clean` command:
```
mendelint clean -o clean.bib library.bib
```
cleans the `library.bib` file and writes the output to `clean.bib`.

Both files are needed because `clean.bib` contains only string references instead of the actual journal names.
The output can be included into a TeX file like this:
```tex
\bibliography{short,clean}
```

To get the same bibliography with long names, replace `short.bib` with `long.bib` generated by
```
mendelint strings long -o long.bib
```

Mendelint supports input and output piping by specifying `-` as the input or output file.
All warnings are printed to stderr.
